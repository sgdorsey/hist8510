"""
Step 3: Align the period models (orthogonal Procrustes)
=======================================================

Each model you trained has its own random orientation: the numbers for
"physical" in the 1896-1919 model can't be compared directly with the
numbers for "physical" in the 1940-1959 model. It's like having three
maps of the same city, each rotated a different amount.

Procrustes alignment finds the rotation that lines one model up with
another as closely as possible, using words that appear often in both
as anchor points. Rotation doesn't stretch or squash anything, so the
distances *within* each model stay exactly the same.

Every model is rotated to line up with the LAST model in MODEL_NAMES.
The aligned versions are saved to models/aligned/.
